## TODO:

### PSM
1. make power saving mode text be lightning bolts when on, something sensible (ice or earthy) when off
2. turn PSM buttons into one toggle button
3. make PSM button run away when you try to click it

### Current Temperature
1. this should do a star fade every time it's changed

### Temperature controle buttons
1. they should be stacked neatly
2. the + button should be constantly morphing
3. the - button should do something fun (maybe move in circles or something? i dunno)
